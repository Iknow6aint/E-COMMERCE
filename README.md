Setup Environment Variables
You will need to provide your own .env variables, here's how you can do it:

create a new file .env in the root
open .env.EXAMPLE
copy the contents and paste it into your own .env file
make sure you replace the values with your own valid values
Note: The NODE_ENV should either be "development" or "production". This will decide which database to use MONGO_LOCAL or MONGO_ATLAS
